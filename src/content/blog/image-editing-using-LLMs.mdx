# My Experience with the Gemini Model: Creating Cats Playing with Yarn


## The Beginning:


I started with a simple prompt: “Generate images of a cat playing with yarn.” The result was a cat with an angry face and a red yarn. The cat wasn’t playing with the yarn as I had hoped.
<ImageList client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Sdz__1OxxEk8D87fwUvpIw.jpeg",
      alt: "Angry cat not at all playing with the yarn",
    },
  ]} />

I have tried to improve this by saying, “The cat must play with the yarn.” The cat’s paw moved a bit, but its expression remained angry, and it still didn’t look playful.
<ImageList client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1_mEyAirAZ5AuKjqXb6Dlg.jpeg",
      alt: "sad looking cat with a yarn",
    },
  ]} />

## Making Adjustments:


Later, I have asked the model to “change the facial expressions of the cat to make it look more like playing.” Although the cat interacted a bit more with the yarn, its angry look stayed the same.

The cat’s expressions looked like it was hungry from a long time. So , have gone to google and searched for. a cat playing with the yarn and tried to mimic the image so I said, “Make the cat stand on two legs, with one leg in the air and the other on the yarn. The cat must be smiling.” The new image was closer to what I wanted, but the cat’s legs were both on the yarn, and its smile looked more like a human’s.


  <ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:656/format:webp/1*T1D2OrkdSo1j6hZydAOyLQ.jpeg",
    alt: "Image from Google showing a cat playing with a yarn",
  },
  {
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:922/format:webp/1*TL1PZau6vdrRZF11dnAg2g.jpeg",
    alt: "Generated image with the given prompt",
  }
  ]} />

## Trying Different Variations:


I have then requested, “Use a different cat.” The model made the change but lost the smile.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*OBkvMc0xAIXLnZ_KI9bWgA.jpeg",
    alt: "different cat with no smile",
  },
  ]} />

When I asked, “Make it smile,” the result was worse, the cat stopped smiling and looked strange.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KspTszS3UCMjb8FhflSoUA.jpeg",
    alt: "Strange looking cat with no smile",
  },
  ]} />

I have decided to try another approach and said, “Make the cat yawn playfully.” The yawn was good, but the cat started to look like a raccoon.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*vwN9VUbIvnSTvYyQ4oxG9A.jpeg",
    alt: "Cat yawning but the body of the cat looks like a raccoon",
  },
  ]} />

I have then asked to “make the cat a little fluffy.” This added a **second yarn** and improved the image, making it the cutest one so far.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wgnhnUhuFVvV3jQyB0rGqw.jpeg",
    alt: "Cat with a second yarn (Cutest One so far)",
  },
  ]} />


## Final Adjustments:


Since I like white cats, I have asked, “Make the cat white.” The new image showed a scared cat instead of a playful one.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*fR_tl7t9ZLkbK2uNARsr1g.jpeg",
    alt: "scared cat with a yawn",
  },
  ]} />


I have tried to be a little witty with the vocabulary and asked the model to “change the yarn, not yawn,” which changed the yarn’s color but made the cat look more human-like and the cat unfortunately lost the yawn.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*hLQASpjSNkF0IEHLpgWc5w.jpeg",
    alt: "white cat playing with a green yarn with a bad posture and no yawn",
  },
  ]} />

Finally, I have told the model, “The yawn should be present.” The model added the yawn back, resulting in a white cat that looked a bit playful with a bluish-green yarn.

<ImageList client:load
  images={[{
    src:"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*LGtbmn_UhAUBVtwmx5djeQ.jpeg",
    alt: "white cat with a bluish green yarn and with a yawn",
  },
  ]} />

## Conclusion:


From this experience, I have learned that the Gemini model is good at handling new details but sometimes forgets earlier ones. At first, I gave it more freedom with what I wanted. As I went along, I got more specific about the cat’s color, so all the images from then on showed a white cat. Later, I allowed more freedom with the yarn, which led to changes in the yarn’s color and shape in the final images.

The biggest surprise was when the model added a second yarn to the cutest picture I had. This showed that while the model follows our instructions closely, it can sometimes forget other details it was working on.

Overall, working with the Gemini model was fun and interesting. It handled many of our requests well, but keeping everything consistent was a bit of a challenge.
